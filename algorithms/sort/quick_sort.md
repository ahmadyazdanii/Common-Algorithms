# QuickSort Algorithm
QuickSort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach to sorting. It works by selecting a pivot element from the array, and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The pivot element is then placed in its final position in the sorted array, and the algorithm recursively sorts the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

Here are the main steps of the QuickSort algorithm:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array (usually the first or last element).
2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements less than the pivot, and one containing elements greater than the pivot.
3. Recursively sort the sub-arrays by repeating steps 1 and 2 until the sub-arrays are empty or contain only one element.
4. Combine the sorted sub-arrays and the pivot element to form the final sorted array.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of QuickSort is O(nlog(n)) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case. The average case is when the partitioning is balanced, meaning that each recursive call divides the array into two sub-arrays of roughly equal size. In this case, the algorithm runs very efficiently, with a time complexity of O(nlog(n)).

However, in the worst case, the partitioning is unbalanced, meaning that one sub-array is much larger than the other. This can happen if the pivot is chosen poorly, such as when it is the smallest or largest element in the array. In this case, the algorithm must make many more comparisons and swaps, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2).

## Memory Complexity
QuickSort has a memory complexity of O(log(n)) due to the recursion used in the algorithm. Each recursive call adds a new level to the call stack, with each level containing two sub-arrays. In the worst case, the stack can grow to a depth of log(n), which means that the memory complexity of QuickSort is O(log(n)).

Overall, QuickSort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm in most cases, but care must be taken to choose a good pivot element to avoid worst-case performance.
